    <p>The appeal filed by the Saligao CCC and the Goa Foundation came up before a three judge bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) Delhi, headed by Justice Swatanter Kumar.</p>

<p>Goa government pulled out three new affidavits together with a copy of the final NEERI EIA report, which they said, had resulted in a new environment clearance for the project dated 3.3.2015.</p>

<p>The NGT was not amused when it heard that the environment clearance had been granted without an environment clearance. Goa government argued that the plot acquired for the solid waste site was now declared an industrial area and therefore did not need an environment clearance. This the presiding judge found unacceptable since the environmental impact would have to be evaluated.</p>

<p>Since the original appeal files from the NGT Pune had not yet reached the NGT Delhi, the Tribunal could not pass any order of stay, as pressed for by the appellants.</p>

<p>NGT permitted the appellants to amend the appeal memo and file any additional grounds, if required, against the issue of the new environment clearance dated 3.3.2015. Appellants will file the amendments in a week. Thereafter, respondents will have two weeks for filing replies. NGT fixed the matter for final disposal on 20/21 April, 2015.</p>
