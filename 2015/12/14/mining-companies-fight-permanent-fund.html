    <p>GOA FOUNDATION CRITICISES APPLICATIONS OF VEDANTA AND
OTHER MINING COMPANIES IN THE SUPREME COURT AGAINST
THE GOA IRON ORE PERMANENT FUND</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Supreme Court, tomorrow (15 December, 2015) will hear applications
  from 5 mining companies against the continuance of the Goa Iron ore
  Permanent Fund.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are at the present, 5 IAs which have been filed by 5 mining
  companies challenging the set up of the Goa Iron Ore Permanent Fund on
  various grounds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These applications have been filed by Vedanta, Fomento, G.N. Aggarwal,
  Geetabhai Parulekar and Prafulla Hede. Prafulla Hede mine is located in 1
  km zone from Mollem Wildlife Sanctuary and the lease has not been
  renewed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vedanta’s application (I.A. No 87) seeks a “clarification” of the Goa
  Foundation judgement dated 21.4.2014 which required all mining companies
  to deposit 10% of sale value of ores extracted and sold by them in a special
  Goan Iron Ore Permanent Fund for the benefit of future generations. The
  application tells the Court that when the Court passed its judgement in the
  1Goa Foundation case, admikttedly there was no provision for raising money
  from miners to compensate for environmental damage and harm to village
  communities. However, after the Mines Act was amended in 2015, there is
  now a provision for setting up District Mineral Foundations in each mining
  district. Hence there is no further need for the Permanent Fund and in any
  case, this would be an instance of “double taxation”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>IAs filed by G.N. Aggarwal and Fomento challenge the idea of the
  Permanent Fund, claiming the issue of a Permanent Fund did not find a
  place during the hearings that led to judgement dated 21.4.2014 and
  therefore they were not heard in the matter. They also state that the
  international price of iron ore has dropped and therefore payments to the
  Permanent Fund would make mining unviable. Geetabhai Parulekar and
  Prafulla Hede want their mining activity to be governed by the amended
  MMDR Act, 1957, in terms of the District Mineral Fund (and not the Goa
  Permanent Fund).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Vedanta application sets out a willful confusion between the nature of a
  Permanent Fund (set up under the judgement dated 21.4.2014) and the
  nature of the District Mineral Fund (DMF) set up under Section 9A of the
  amended MMDR Act, 1957. The two are different agencies, addressing
  different aspects of sustainability and Intergenerational Equity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nature of the DMF can be described succinctly in the following terms:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>a) DMF would provide for the expenditures related to rehabilitation of
environment caused by mining activity. This would also include harm to
affected village communities in which the activity is being carried out.
Scope of DMF operations is the district.

2b) The DMF is therefore a spending fund: money deposited in the Fund
is to be spent on activities covered under the amendment. Therefore,
the DMF would be in the form of a non-profit trust.
</code></pre>
</div>

<ol>
  <li>The nature of the Permanent Fund is the very opposite, and can be
  described succintly in the following terms:</li>
</ol>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>a) The PF would deal with the requirement of meeting the demands of
intergenerational equity, that is, the interests of future generations, not
only the present. Therefore, by definition, it would be a fund that would
save, not spend.

b) Principal activity of the fund would be protection against inflation,
investment in activities that would create durable assets in the long
term, etc. PF area would be the entire state. In contrast with the DMF,
the Fund would be a profit making activity. Fund managers must ensure
intelligent investments to ensure economic yields, in order to maintain
the original value of the fund. The public exchequer would benefit only
when there is a surplus after adjusting for inflation.
</code></pre>
</div>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Expert Committee of the Supreme Court, in fact, has said that the idea
  of the Goan Iron Ore Permanent Fund should now be applied in all states
  where such mining is taking place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the Goa Foundation, Vedanta should be the last person to file
  this application. It is well established that the Applicant Vedanta benefitted
  well beyond any reasonable measure from iron ore extraction belonging to
  the present and future generations of people living in Goa.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The largesse garnered by the company in the past 8 years of mining is simply staggering.
  Based on the applicant’s annual reports, our estimates show that during the
  last 8 full years of mining (2004-05 – 2011-12), the applicant sold Rs. 33,280
  3crores of iron ore and reported a profit after tax to the extent Rs. 12,346
  crores! A generous 20% return on assets would have been only Rs. 1,239
  crores. Thus, Vedanta’s excess profits were to the tune of Rs. 11,108 crores.
  Had the Permanent Fund imposition been in place during these 8 years, the
  applicant would have had to pay only a maximum of Rs 3,328 crores, still
  much smaller than the excess profits that accrued to it.</p>

<p>This amount would still have been saved for the owners of the iron ore, the future generations of
  Goans. Through this application, the applicant is now trying to deny even
  this pittance and caviling at a small amount to be saved for Goa’s future
  generations.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Goa Foundation is telling the Apex Court that Goans are not beggars
  who are ready to sell their ore at throwaway rates. If the mining companies
  are not able to make their contributions to the Permanent Fund, the
  Government should step in and resume the leases. The ore is owned by the
  government in any case, on behalf of the public. Prior to 2004, when the
  mining boom commenced, most mines preferred to remain shut rather than
  sell ore at ridiculously low international prices.</li>
