Thanks for being one of our enthusiastic supporters! When people send money by internet banking, we should be informed, so we can check the account and issue a receipt. Address of the person sending the donation is not essential at the moment, since we can scan the receipt and email it. Address would be required if the person donating wants the original copy of the receipt.
